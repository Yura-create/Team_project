# Team_project
Team work for the university. This project was created by Ільченко Юрій, Круглік Маргарита, Вірянська Дар'я, Ухін Тимур.

We created the website for a vet clinic called PETlya.

In this project, we've used HTML, CSS(front-end), and Python with the framework Django(for back-end). In our repository, you can see a lot of directories and files, such as:

PETlya(directory): one of the main directories, which includes .py files for editing the project and supporting its workability.

PETlyaAPP(directory): again important directory is used for interpreting web pages and creating multi-page websites, also connects the database to the project.

static(directory): contain all CSS, JS files, and images that are used in the project.

templates(directory): contain html files that are used in the project.

db.sqlite3(file): the main database.

manage.py(file): the main file with which you will interact(to run a local server, create new apps, etc.)

requirements.txt(file): contains all libraries and frameworks that are used in the project.
